# üè† Home-Manager Specific Configuration

- Define user-level settings and tools that integrate seamlessly with **home-manager**.

### üî® Building the Home-Manager Configuration

To build the home-manager configuration, run:

```bash
home-manager switch --flake .#<machine>
```

#### Prerequisites:
1. Ensure **Nix** is installed on your system with **flakes** enabled.
2. Install the **home-manager** package.

---

### ‚ö° Temporary Setup

If you don‚Äôt want to install **home-manager** via your system's package manager, you can initialize it temporarily using **Nix**:

1. Start a temporary shell with home-manager available:
   ```bash
   nix shell nixpkgs#home-manager
   ```
2. Once inside the shell, let **home-manager** install itself as part of your configuration.

This avoids permanent installation while still allowing you to use home-manager effectively.
