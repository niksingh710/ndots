# ðŸš€ Custom Packages Packaged by Me

### A Collection of Custom-Packaged Tools

These are the custom packages I've packaged for personal use.
Most packages are compatible with all systems specified in `flake.nix`. If a package is system-specific, this will be noted in its description.

---

### ðŸ”¨ Installing a Package

To use the packages, add the flake as an input in your configuration:

```bash
inputs = {
    nikpkgs.url = "github:niksingh710/ndots";
    nikpkgs.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
};
```

Once added, install the package using:

```bash
inputs.nikpkgs.packages.<package-name>
```

---

### âš¡ Quick Run

You can quickly run the package without installing it using:

```bash
nix run "github:niksingh710/ndots#<pkgname>"
```

Or bring the package into a shell environment with:

```bash
nix shell "github:niksingh710/ndots#<pkgname>"
```
